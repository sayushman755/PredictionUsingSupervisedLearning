# PredictionUsingSupervisedLearning
This Jupyter notebook uses linear regression to predict student scores based on study hours. It starts by loading and exploring a dataset that includes two columns: Hours and Scores. The notebook shows how to visualize the data using scatter plots and regression lines.

Next, the data is split into training and testing sets. The training data is used to create and fit a linear regression model, while the testing data helps evaluate the model's performance. Key metrics like R-squared are used to see how well the model predicts the scores.

The notebook also demonstrates how to make predictions with new data. For example, it predicts the score for a student who studies for 9.25 hours.

The project uses popular Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and scikit-learn for building and evaluating the model.
